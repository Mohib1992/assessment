					<i>Nuwan Gomes</i> and <i>Robi Rahman</i> are two young professionals with several years of experiencein the consulting and project management field. The initial notion of building a partnership one fine 
					day whilst completing their master's degrees at the University of Applied Science in Vienna, Austria 
					turned into an actual vision of starting up a tangible business together. This vision, combined with 
					the compulsion of making a positive change in lesser developed regions of the world, led them to the 
					concept of "3Spire" - a single venture that diverts into several branches.
