				<p>Utilizing their IT background and several years of international experience in order to accomplish the vision of helping young, enthusiastic students start up their careers has been one of their many goals. As the global world of outsourcing keeps growing, they realized that a large number of IT businesses had opened up in the Asian subcontinent, 
				but are being run by big organizations that only hire experienced professionals.</p>
				<p>3Spireâ€™s IT branch has been founded on the notion to give young 
				students originating from weak social backgrounds an opportunity to evolve and utilize their skills and talent in order to achieve a
				better future for themselves.  The goal is to not only form them into experts of their field, but to also provide professional guidance through
				the various stages of their personal development. At this time two young students from Dhaka have been taken under the wings of 3Spire whilst 
				plans are being made to increase the number of students gradually as the business expands.
