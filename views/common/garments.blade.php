				<p>Learning about the difficulties garments workers face each day in their working environment led Nuwan Gomes and Robi Rahman to research 
				more about working conditions in such factories. Their initial thought and aim “We discovered the grievances and decided to try our best to 
				ensure quality products are been manufactured whilst ensuring health & safety of our employees as well as their development and secure future.”
				Furthermore, they learned that the social and health standards one enjoys in Europe are not existent for employees in Asian countries. With the
				aim of making a difference, they reached out to small businesses in Asia and decided to help them become a part of the competitive market hence 
				giving people in rural areas a chance to live a better life while ensuring the export of high quality products.</p>
				
				<p>“The ambition we set for ourselves is not to be part of the existing garments trade industry, but to start a an honorable way of producing and 
				exporting products as well as giving individuals the possibility of leading a better and healthy life in the future.” 3Spire is aiming to reach this
				objective with many small fabric owners in rural areas who are ready to provide their employees with correlating working environments and 
				advancement opportunities. The firms 3Spire work together with commit themselves to reimburse their employees with a moderate wage and healthy 
				working conditions such as regulated work schedules, a safe environment and many other benefits for employees. </p>
