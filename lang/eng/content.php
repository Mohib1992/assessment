    'WhoWeAreDetail' => '<i>Nuwan Gomes</i> and <i>Robi Rahman</i> are two young professionals with several years of experiencein the consulting and project management field. The initial notion of building a partnership one fine
					day whilst completing their masters degrees at the University of Applied Science in Vienna, Austria
					turned into an actual vision of starting up a tangible business together. This vision, combined with
					the compulsion of making a positive change in lesser developed regions of the world, led them to the
					concept of 3Spire - a single venture that diverts into several branches.',

    'InformationTechnologyDetail' => '<p>Utilizing their IT background and several years of international experience in order to accomplish the vision of helping young, enthusiastic students start up their careers has been one of their many goals. As the global world of outsourcing keeps growing, they realized that a large number of IT businesses had opened up in the Asian subcontinent,
				but are being run by big organizations that only hire experienced professionals.</p>
				<p>3Spire’s IT branch has been founded on the notion to give young
				students originating from weak social backgrounds an opportunity to evolve and utilize their skills and talent in order to achieve a
				better future for themselves.  The goal is to not only form them into experts of their field, but to also provide professional guidance through
				the various stages of their personal development. At this time two young students from Dhaka have been taken under the wings of 3Spire whilst
				plans are being made to increase the number of students gradually as the business expands.

    'GarmentsDetail' => '<p>Learning about the difficulties garments workers face each day in their working environment led Nuwan Gomes and Robi Rahman to research
				more about working conditions in such factories. Their initial thought and aim “We discovered the grievances and decided to try our best to
				ensure quality products are been manufactured whilst ensuring health & safety of our employees as well as their development and secure future.”
				Furthermore, they learned that the social and health standards one enjoys in Europe are not existent for employees in Asian countries. With the
				aim of making a difference, they reached out to small businesses in Asia and decided to help them become a part of the competitive market hence
				giving people in rural areas a chance to live a better life while ensuring the export of high quality products.</p>

				<p>“The ambition we set for ourselves is not to be part of the existing garments trade industry, but to start a an honorable way of producing and
				exporting products as well as giving individuals the possibility of leading a better and healthy life in the future.” 3Spire is aiming to reach this
				objective with many small fabric owners in rural areas who are ready to provide their employees with correlating working environments and
				advancement opportunities. The firms 3Spire work together with commit themselves to reimburse their employees with a moderate wage and healthy
				working conditions such as regulated work schedules, a safe environment and many other benefits for employees. </p>'
